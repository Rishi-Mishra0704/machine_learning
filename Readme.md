## 🛠️ Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishi-Mishra0704/machine_learning
cd machine_learning
```

2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac  
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows  
```
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4️⃣ Explore the Projects
Navigate to the notebook/ directory and open any Jupyter Notebook:

```bash

jupyter notebook
```
🔄 Using the converter.py Tool
The converter.py utility is designed to easily convert between Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks.

🔁 Convert Python Script to Jupyter Notebook
To convert .py files in the script/ directory to .ipynb files in the notebook/ directory:

```bash

python converter.py --to ipynb
```
🔁 Convert Jupyter Notebook to Python Script
To convert .ipynb files in the notebook/ directory to .py files in the script/ directory:

```bash
python converter.py --to py
```
